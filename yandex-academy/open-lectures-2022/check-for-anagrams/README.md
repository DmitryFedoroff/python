# Check for anagrams

## Description:

Given two strings, you need to check if one is an anagram of the other. According to Collins English Dictionary, an anagram is a word or phrase that can have its letters rearranged to spell another word or phrase different from the original word.

## Note:

Input: The strings consist of small Latin letters, their length does not exceed `100,000`. Each is written on a separate line.

Output: Print `Yes` if one of the strings is an anagram of the other and `No` otherwise.

## Examples:

```
Input: dusty
       study
Output: Yes
```
```
Input: rat
       bat
Output: No
```
