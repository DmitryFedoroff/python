# Groups and classrooms

## Description:

The university has `n` classrooms and `m` study groups. Each classroom has its capacity and each group has its size. A group can study in the classroom only if its number of students does not exceed the size of the classroom. Determine the maximum number of groups that can be seated in the classrooms.

## Note:

In the first line, enter `n` number (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`). In the second line, enter numbers - the capacity of the classrooms separated by whitespace. Capacity does not exceed `100,000`. In the third line, enter `m` number (`1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`). In the fourth line, enter numbers - capacity of groups separated by whitespace. The numbers do not exceed `100,000`.

Output: Print the maximum number of groups that can be seated in the classrooms.
