# Majority element

## Description:

Given an array of integers of size `n`, find the majority element in the array. The majority element is the element that appears more than `n/2` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Note:

Input: In the first line, enter `n` number (`1 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4`). In the second line, enter `n` numbers separated by whitespace. The numbers do not exceed 10^9 modulo.

Output: Print the majority element in the array.

## Examples:

```
Input: 3
       1 2 1
Output: 1
```
```
Input: 7
       7 5 5 5 5 4 5
Output: 5
```
```
