# Cows in stalls

## Description:

On a straight line there are stalls in which it is necessary to arrange the cows so that the minimum distance between the cows is as large as possible.

## Note:

Input: In the first line, enter number of stalls `n` (`2 < n < 10001`) and number of cows `k` (`1 < k < n`). In the second line, enter `n` natural numbers in ascending order - stalls coordinates. The coordinates do not exceed `10^9` by their absolute values (modulus).

Output: Print one number - the largest possible allowable distance.

## Example:

```
Input: 6 3
       2 5 7 11 15 20
Output: 9
```
