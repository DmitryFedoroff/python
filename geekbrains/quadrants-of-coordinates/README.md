# Find quadrant in which coordinates lie

## Description:

Given the rectangular coordinate system that consists of four quadrants. Write a program to find the quadrant in which the user-defined `x` and `y` coordinates lie or on which axis they are located.

## Note:

Input: In the first line enter the `x` coordinate and in the second line enter the `y` coordinate of the point.

Output: Print the quadrant in which the user-defined coordinates lie or on which axis they are located.

## Example:

```
Input: -3.8
        9
Output: II
```
```
Input: 5
       0
Output: 0X
```
```
Input: 0
       7.2
Output: 0Y
```
