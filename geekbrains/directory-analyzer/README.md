# Directory analyzer

## Description:

Develop a directory analyzer application that scans a specified directory, collecting detailed information about its contents, including both files and subdirectories. The program should recursively traverse the directory structure, capturing data such as the type (file or directory), name, size, and parent directory for each item found. Additionally, the tool must offer functionality to serialize the gathered data into `JSON`, `CSV`, and `pickle` formats, allowing for easy storage and analysis of the directory's composition and size distribution.
